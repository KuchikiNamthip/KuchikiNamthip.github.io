## What is Hippo Pathway
The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved network that plays a critical role in regulating various biological processes, including 
1. Regulation of Cell Growth and Proliferation - The Hippo pathway inhibits excessive cell growth and division by phosphorylating and inactivating YAP and TAZ
2. Control of Organ Size - It ensures that organs grow to their appropriate size by balancing cell growth with cell death.
3. Tissue Regeneration and Wound Healing

## Dysregulation and Disease Implications 
Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway can lead to various diseases \
😱 Cancer \
💔 Cardiac Diseases \
🫁 Pulmonary Diseases \
🧪 Renal Diseases \
🍸 Hepatic Diseases \
👁️ Eye Diseases \
🛡️ Immune Dysfunction 
	
## Key Roles of the Hippo Pathway in Cancer
1. Tumor Suppression - The Hippo pathway acts as a critical tumor suppressor by inhibiting excessive cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Dysregulation of this pathway can lead to the uncontrolled growth characteristic of cancer.
2. Oncogenic Activation - In many cancers, the Hippo pathway is found to be inactivated, resulting in the overactivation of YAP/TAZ. This promotes oncogenesis by driving the expression of genes that facilitate cell growth and survival, contributing to tumor progression
3. Cancer Stem Cell Biology

🔬💊 Given its significant role in health and disease, targeting the components of the Hippo pathway has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating various conditions, particularly cancers
