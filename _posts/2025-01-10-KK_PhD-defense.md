Check out the poster I made for my Ph.D. defense! I went with an Iron Man theme.

This video is my way of expressing deep gratitude to everyone who has been part of my cancer research journey, from my early days as a high school student to this significant milestone - completing my PhD. Your support, encouragement, and guidance over the years have made this achievement possible. This journey in cancer research began when I was still in high school, and thanks to countless mentors, colleagues, friends, and supporters, I've reached this important milestone. Thank you for being part of this meaningful journey.
