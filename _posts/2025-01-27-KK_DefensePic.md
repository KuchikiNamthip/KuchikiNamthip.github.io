## With my greatest mentor
This artwork, meticulously crafted with Thai gold leaf, is a deeply personal tribute to Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Since encountering this book at thirteen, its message of transcending limitations has resonated deeply within me. Jonathan's pursuit of higher flight, in contrast to the complacency of his flock, has always symbolized my own aspirations. Jonathan's life was transformed by an encounter with an elder seagull, whose shared stories of flight ignited his confidence and fueled his dreams.  Like Jonathan, I spent years searching for my own "senior seagull," a mentor to guide me.  How lucky I am 😁 to have finally found him in my exceptional Ph.D. advisor. I am deeply grateful for his influence. This piece is a thoughtful expression of Jonathan's inspiring journey and my profound gratitude for the mentorship that has shaped my path. \

These are photos of my esteemed Ph.D. mentor, Associate Professor Dr. Siwanon Jirawatnotai.
