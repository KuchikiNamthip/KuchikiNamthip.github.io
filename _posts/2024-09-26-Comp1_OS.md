## Introduction

For this part of [My Computer Workbench](https://kuchikinamthip.github.io/projects/ComBio), I would like to explain about the operating system(OS) that I am using. 

## Operating system
Since Linux is widely used for High Performance Computing (HPC) for analyzing upstream -omics. Ubuntu is the most famous Linux distribution in the computational biology field.

Therefore, I used Linux as my operating system and Ubuntu as my distribution. This helped a lot in practicing Unix command line. I started by installing Linux myself with the kind help of my friends (software engineers(Guy & Bui)) and my teacher (she was working on molecular docking). I also took a Linux Foundation course to understand basic command line and other topics. 
Here is my computer, which I use for simple work with a 32 GB of RAM.

The Linux system seems to be working well; however, program installation is complex when it comes to debugging.
