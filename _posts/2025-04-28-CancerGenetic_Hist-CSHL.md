Mind-blown by the "Cancer Genetics: History & Consequences" meeting!
hosted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 

Learning about the genetic basis of cancer and the journey of oncogene research to treatment.

Even the US timezone couldn't dampen my enthusiasm – panda eyes and all! 😉

The buzz from other attendees in [the interview clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=TTewb89yFdHivd3e&v=G3OeGiZZTWM&feature=youtu.be) speaks volumes about this golden era of cancer science.
