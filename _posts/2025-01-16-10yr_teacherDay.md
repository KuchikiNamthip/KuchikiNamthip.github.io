Thailand, where I was raised, \
is a country deeply rooted in a culture of \
unwavering respect for teachers. 

We forever honor those who guided our path.

In Thai, January 16th of every year is Teachers' Day. 

For ten years, I've sent Happy Teacher's Day cards to my teachers. 
It began as a simple annual greeting. 

Now, even though I've grown up, become a pharmacist, and (nearly) earned a Ph.D., 
I remain their student and will always respect them from the bottom of my heart.

May the words 'Happy Teacher's Day' \
be etched in our hearts for all teachers. 

May the light of wisdom you have given us \
illuminate and guide your students forever, 
from now, ten years and for eternity.
