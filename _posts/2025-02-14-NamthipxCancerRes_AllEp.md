"Namthip x Cancer Research" is the story of how Namthip came to love cancer research. This story began when Namthip lost her beloved grandmother to colorectal cancer at the age of 14. This profound loss inspired her to find a way to combat the disease.

She explored many avenues for fighting this painful illness.  The only truly promising path, "Science and Research," resonated deeply with her. She explored different facets of cancer research and ultimately decided to pursue a Ph.D. in System Pharmacology and Precision Medicine.
