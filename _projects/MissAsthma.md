### About "มิสหอบหืด - MISS ASTHMA THAILAND"

**MISS ASTHMA THAILAND** is a social media initiative and community platform dedicated to providing valuable knowledge and fostering a supportive environment for individuals living with asthma. The project's mission is to raise awareness about the seriousness of asthma, empowering the community to manage their condition effectively and challenge common misconceptions.

### Our Story

The journey of **MISS ASTHMA THAILAND** is led by a founder who is an asthmatic herself. Having been called "Iron Man" by her doctor for her resilience in overcoming the disease and building her strength back up, she was inspired to create a space for others like her. The founder's personal experience, from a high school student with a passion for science to eventually pursuing a Ph.D. in cancer research, fuels her dedication to effective health communication. This experience is what shaped the project's unique voice and its commitment to blending scientific knowledge with a personal, relatable perspective.

### What We Do

We share stories and knowledge about asthma in a fun, engaging, and easy-to-understand way. Our content breaks down difficult topics and presents them with a touch of humor and imagination. We aim to show that while asthma can be a serious condition—what we call "หอบหืดโรคใสใสแต่ไม่กุ๊งกิ๊ง"—it doesn't have to hold you back. We believe in providing a platform where asthmatics can find support, share their experiences, and feel empowered.

### Our Audience & Goal

Our target audience is the Thai public and especially those living with asthma. We aim to debunk myths and clarify the seriousness of the disease, which, while manageable, can be fatal if not taken seriously. We believe that curiosity and excitement are the keys to a deeper understanding of the world, and we hope to inspire that same feeling in our audience. We are here to be an asthmatic friend to all who need one.
