    Overview of Cholangiocarcinoma Stem Cells Project

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a malignancy with a dismal prognosis, is characterized by a high proportion of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Traditional methods for identifying CCA CSCs often fail to capture their dynamic nature. This study demonstrated a correlation between poor patient outcomes and the dual expression of SOX2/OCT4. Consequently, we established CCA cell lines harboring a live-cell CSC-specific reporter (SORE6) to track these cells. Analysis of five CCA cell lines revealed SORE6-positive (SORE6+) cells. These CCA CSC models were validated by assessing key CSC properties, including self-renewal, differentiation potential, and tumorigenicity. Furthermore, the reporter system, in conjunction with cell surface markers, allowed for the characterization of CCA CSC heterogeneity. Under standard CCA chemotherapies, the SORE6+ CSC population was enriched, likely due to intrinsic drug resistance and dedifferentiation capabilities. Importantly, treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors was found to reduce the SORE6+ CCA cell population.

### üî¨ CSC Models Developed
In addition to conventional assays, we developed and validated **three complementary CSC models** to better represent tumor biology:

1. **2D SORE6 Reporter System** ‚Äì a live-cell biosensor for real-time CSC tracking in CCA cell lines.  
2. **3D Multicellular Spheroid Model** ‚Äì currently a complex 3D cell architecture model that better mimics tumor-like structure. While not yet a full co-culture, it has potential to be extended toward stromal and immune interactions in future work.  
3. **3D Multi-spheroids Model** ‚Äì a high-throughput culture that enables quantification of tumorigenic potential and drug response at scale. 
 
The **3D multi-spheroids model** formed the foundation of our recent publication in **Scientific Reports (2025)** {% cite Kongtanawanich2025_SciRep %}, where we integrated high-content confocal imaging and computational pipelines for intensive quantitative CSC analysis and drug-response profiling.
