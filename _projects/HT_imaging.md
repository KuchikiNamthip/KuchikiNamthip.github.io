## Introduction
As a proud member of the [Siriraj Center of Research Excellence for Systems Pharmacology (SiSP)](https://www.sisyspharm.org/), a leader in high-throughput imaging, I am driven by a passion for uncovering the secrets of cancer biology. My work combines a hands-on approach in the lab with cutting-edge image analysis. I have specialized in exploring a wide array of cellular models, moving from the traditional 2-dimensional (2D) cell cultures to advanced 3-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroids and multi-spheroid systems. This diverse experience allows me to tackle complex biological questions with creativity and precision. Beyond the visuals, I am also an expert in using RStudio to dive deep into the data, ensuring that every image tells a complete and compelling story.

## Model 1:  2D Cancer Cell Culturing Model
### 1.1 Analysis overview:
In this model, my work centered on utilizing cancer stem cell (CSC) reporter systems to study the dynamics of cancer cells in a flat, 2D environment. I employed high-content real-time imaging to precisely monitor the CSC phenotype and understand its behavior over time.

A key part of this work involved a high-throughput drug response study, where I evaluated the effects of various drugs on cancer cells, with a specific focus on their impact on the CSC population. Using this approach, I was able to establish a direct link between CSC biology and drug response. By analyzing the data, I could determine how much a specific drug concentration killed the cells, and in parallel, how that same concentration affected the percentage of cancer stem cells.

I also developed a detailed step-by-step methodology to create an algorithm that could compare the effects of different drugs on the CSC proportion across a comparable dose range. This systematic approach allowed for a robust comparison of drug efficacies from the perspective of both general cell death and the specific targeting of the CSC population. The imaging data was then analyzed using Columbus‚Ñ¢ Image Data Storage and Analysis System (PerkinElmer), enabling a sophisticated, single-cell level analysis. The resulting data was further explored and visualized using RStudio, revealing a comprehensive view of drug efficacy and its influence on CSCs.

### 1.2 Key Applications:

- *Monitoring CSC Phenotype*: Used a reporter system with high-content real-time imaging to precisely monitor the behavior of cancer stem cells (CSCs).

## Model 2: 3D Cancer Cell Culturing Model (3D Multicellular Spheroid, 3D Multi-Spheroid)
### 2.1 Analysis overview:

To create a more realistic and complex environment for cancer studies, I developed and investigated advanced 3D culturing models, including both 3D multicellular spheroids and multi-spheroid systems. This approach allowed me to move beyond the limitations of 2D culture and study CSC phenotypes within a more natural, three-dimensional context using high-content imaging.

I also conducted tumorigenic assays, which are crucial for understanding the potential of cancer cells to form tumors. This was done with high-throughput imaging and subsequent image analysis at the single spheroid level using PerkinElmer's Columbus software. This detailed analysis provided valuable insights into the growth and behavior of tumors in a 3D setting. The data was then rigorously analyzed using RStudio to draw meaningful conclusions about the tumorigenic potential of the cells.

### 2.2 Key Applications:

### 1.3 What I have learned from this data set
This transcriptomics analysis marks a significant milestone in my computational biology portfolio, representing a journey of deep exploration and reflection. I meticulously examined each step of the process, documenting my insights and rationale along the way. These detailed explanations can be found within the project files, providing a comprehensive guide to my analytical approach.

Furthermore, a question that arose during the analysis sparked the creation of a blog post: ["What are GO, msigDB, KEGG, ORA, and GSEA in transcriptomics analysis?"](https://kuchikinamthip.github.io/blog/2024/msigDB_ORA_GSEA/) This post delves into the intricacies of these essential tools and concepts, offering a valuable resource for anyone navigating the world of transcriptomics.

## Last note from me
 - I'm sorry for coding resource. I will upload the R code to my [GitHub](https://github.com/KuchikiNamthip) as soon as possible. The code is very unreadable (even to me, haha üòÜüòÜ!), because these image analysis scripts were some of my very first coding projects. I was practicing by doing real-world data analysis (Yes!, my Ph.D. thesis), and looking back at it now, it feels like I'm recalling a previous life. That's because of my poor coding practices at the beginning (when I didn't have any support from an LLM at that time).
 - Another publication which directly relates to this ["Phenomics x High-Throughput Imaging in 2D and 3D Culturing Models"](https://kuchikinamthip.github.io/projects/HT_imaging/) is under review. Once it is published I will update this page with more information. Please bear with me!ü§ó
