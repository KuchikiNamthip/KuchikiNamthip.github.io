### About "NO CANCER THAILAND"

**NO CANCER THAILAND** is a social media initiative dedicated to improving science communication and health literacy in Thailand. The project's mission is to translate complex cancer research into accessible and engaging content for the public. It aims to empower individuals with a scientific understanding of cancer, encouraging them to make informed health decisions and critically evaluate unproven treatments.

### Our Story

The journey began over a decade ago with a simple website created by a high school student. That initial passion for science eventually led to a Ph.D. in cancer research. Today, that passion has evolved into the **NO CANCER THAILAND** social media project, founded by **Dr. "Namthip" Kritiyaporn Kongthanawanich**, a pharmacist and dedicated cancer researcher.

### What We Do

We share stories about cancer research in a fun and easy-to-understand way. Our content breaks down difficult topics and presents them with a touch of humor and imagination, ensuring that everyone—from high school students to busy adults—can enjoy learning about science. We believe that curiosity and excitement are the keys to a deeper understanding of the world, and we hope to inspire that same feeling in our audience.

### Our Audience & Goal

Our target audience is the Thai public that may be skeptical of modern medicine and scientific evidence, often turning to unproven remedies or misleading information. We believe that science communication is crucial. 
> "No matter how brilliant science and research are, \
> They are rendered meaningless \
> If people continue to treat cancer with boiling unscientific leaves \
> Instead of proven drugs." \

### Acknowledgement
🌸 I would like to thank my Ph.D. advisor, [Assoc.Prof.Dr. Siwanon Jirawatnotai](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=5nSlAnIAAAAJ&hl=en). Without him, I would not have discovered the exciting world of cancer biology. 🌞🌞 From that point, I expanded my interest to the -omic fields for a deeper understanding. On the other side, I also I want to tell Thai people the knowledge I gain as a real-life cancer scientist. 

🌸 I want to express my gratitude to [Dr. Namchai Chewawiwat](https://www.facebook.com/namchai.chewawiwat), who I consider one of Thailand's greatest science communicators. I first met him in 2009 at the 2nd Thai Science Camp when I was in high school. His presentations were so inspiring and easy to understand that I still recall many of them vividly. 

Becoming his fan and following his writing online fueled my passion for science and eventually led me to pursue my Ph.D. I believe that science communication is incredibly important. While research and new discoveries are vital for saving lives, it's just as critical for a layperson to understand the basics of science and apply critical thinking. After all, what good is groundbreaking research if people reject life-saving treatments for unscientific alternatives?

🌸 I want to express my gratitude to my grandmother. Losing my grandmother to colorectal cancer during my Grade 8 year was a deeply impactful event that ignited my interest in cancer. In my grief, I sought to learn as much as possible about the disease, exploring everything from dietary approaches and herbal treatments to online resources and the inspiring work of Princess Chulabhorn reported in the royal news. This initial exploration eventually guided me towards the field of science and research.

🌸 Lastly, I would like to express my sincere and deepest gratitude to [Professor Dr. Her Royal Highness Princess Chulabhorn Krom Phra Srisavangavadhana](https://www.cri.or.th/about-the-president/), who has been an unwavering role model and my highest source of inspiration. 

I have followed news of her royal duties and her tireless dedication to cancer research since I was a high school student in 2006. It was her strong commitment that truly sparked my own journey into the world of cancer science and research.
