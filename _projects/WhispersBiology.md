**The Whispers of Biology** is a blog and community space dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of science. It’s where computational biology tricks, scientific thoughts, and other insights are shared with fellow enthusiasts. The project's mission is to inspire and support others who share a passion for scientific inquiry and to show that a career in research can be an incredibly fun and rewarding journey.

### Our Story

The name _“The Whispers of Biology”_ comes from a profound experience during the founder's Ph.D. studies. In research, the outcome of an experiment is often unpredictable, with many possible paths to follow. It was a favorite saying of the founder’s advisor that inspired the name: "It depends on where the biology leads us." This phrase perfectly captures the essence of scientific discovery—we simply follow the "whispers" of science and see where the journey takes us. This blog is a place to share the excitement and passion that comes from analyzing complex results and unraveling the mysteries of biology, particularly in the field of oncology.

### What We Do

We share scientific knowledge and stories in an engaging and accessible way. Our content covers various topics, from computational biology tricks to personal reflections on the research journey. The blog aims to demystify complex subjects and highlight the thrill of discovery. We believe that science is a path of curiosity and excitement, and we hope to inspire others to follow their own scientific passions.

### Our Audience & Goal

Our target audience is anyone with a love for science, from students to seasoned researchers. We aim to create a supportive community where we can share insights, celebrate breakthroughs, and navigate the challenges of scientific research together. We want to be a friend to those who find joy in the complex and the challenging, and who are ready to follow the whispers of biology wherever they may lead.

### Acknowledgement

_"The Whispers of Biology"_ would not be possible without the incredible support and guidance of many mentors along the way including _Emeritus Professor M.R. Jisnuson Svasti_, _Prof. Dr. Apiwat Mutirangura_, _Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nakarin Kitkumthorn_, and _Asst. Prof. Dr. Worapong Phupong_.

🧩 I am especially grateful to [_Dr. Kriengsak Lirdprapamongkol_](https://www.cri.or.th/dr-kriengsak-lirdprapamongkol/) and [_Assoc. Prof. Dr. Jitbanjong Tangpong_](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kHV6NnkAAAAJ&hl=en) who have mentored me since high school, and to [_Assoc. Prof. Dr. Apichart Apiratin_](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Apichart-Atipairin) who served as my Pharm.D. thesis advisor.

🧩 I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to [_Dr. Ming (Tommy) Tang_](https://x.com/tangming2005) for his invaluable encouragement and the wealth of knowledge he has generously shared through his various online platforms. His tutorials, books, and blogs—each a masterclass in breaking down complex topics from foundational principles to advanced concepts—have been instrumental in making my journey into computational biology possible. Tommy's consistent encouragement to share my own experiences with others has been particularly impactful. It led me to connect with many friends in the community, and it is this spirit of sharing, conversing, and helping others that continues to inspire my own efforts in building a supportive community.

🧩 I would like to express my deepest gratitude especially to my Ph.D. advisor, [_Assoc.Prof.Dr. Siwanon Jirawatnotai_](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=5nSlAnIAAAAJ&hl=en), whose wisdom and insight helped me to navigate the complex world of scientific research. It was his phrase, "It depends on where the biology leads us," that sparked the idea for this project and taught me to embrace the unpredictable and beautiful journey of scientific discovery. Thank you for your belief in my potential and for showing me the true art of following the whispers of science.

🎯 My Ph.D. advisor encourages me to write in Thai to connect with the local community [**(NO CANCER THAILAND)**](https://kuchikinamthip.github.io/projects/NoCancer/). \
🎯 While Tommy cheers me on to write in English to reach a global audience [**(The Whispers of Biology)**](https://kuchikinamthip.github.io/projects/WhispersBiology/).

**The result? I write in both!**
I am grateful for their support 🥰🥰, which has empowered me to share my experiences and insights with a wider audience, no matter the language.
