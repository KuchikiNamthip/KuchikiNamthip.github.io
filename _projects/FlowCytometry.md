## Acknowledgement
- I would like to thank my co-authors and colleagues.

- I would like to thank my teachers and my co-advisors. \
  🚀 [Emerita Prof.Dr. Marianne Hokland](https://www.au.dk/en/mhokland@biomed.au.dk),. \
  🚀 [Asst.Prof.Dr. Methichit Wattanapanitch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iUbQpfkAAAAJ&hl=en), who provided intensive and exclusive discussions from a healthy stem cell perspective.

- Thanks Itai Yanai: and his gorilla experiment --> make a link
  
- Lastly, I would like to thank my Ph.D. advisor, [Assoc.Prof.Dr. Siwanon Jirawatnotai](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=5nSlAnIAAAAJ&hl=en). Without him, I would not have discovered the exciting world of cancer biology. 🌞🌞 From that point, I expanded my interest to the -omic fields (including Phenomics) for a deeper understanding. 🤩🤩

## Last note from me
 - I'm sorry for coding resource. I will upload the R code to my [GitHub](https://github.com/KuchikiNamthip) as soon as possible. It is my very first coding projects. I was practicing by doing real-world data analysis (Yes!, my Ph.D. thesis). I didn't have any support from an LLM at that time.
