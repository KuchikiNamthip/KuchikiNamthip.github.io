### Our Story

The **"Exercise Mania Patients"** Facebook group was founded by _"Namthip" Krittiyabhorn Kongtanawanich_ as a space for people with various diseases to share their experiences and support one another. The name of the group, **"‡∏Ñ‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏•‡∏±‡∏á"** came from a combination of a nickname given to the founder by her friends, who often called her _"‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏•‡∏±‡∏á"_ and a doctor's comment about a cancer patient named **Somyos**, who exercised a lot to fight his disease. The doctor referred to **Somyos** as a **"‡∏Ñ‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏•‡∏±‡∏á" (Exercise Mania Patient)**. This inspired the founder(including **Somyos** himself) to create a group with the same name to unite patients and provide a space for encouragement. The group now has over 790 members.

### What We Do

The "Exercise Mania Patients" group received support from the event organizers such as Thai Cancer Society and AIA. The group engages in community outreach by participating in many events. These activities help to foster a supportive environment and encourage physical activity among members.
